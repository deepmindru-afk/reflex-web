# Player EAN – Requirement Management & Traceability

Writing specs is easy; keeping them consistent as designs evolve is the hard part.
Player EAN gives hardware and product teams a single workspace to draft requirements, link dependencies, and flag anything that might break downstream—all without leaving a clean dark-mode editor.

### What you can build

* **Single-Source Requirements Docs** – create structured specs with IDs like `BRAKE-001` and render them in Markdown or HTML.
* **Live Traceability Links** – connect specs in seconds; if a parent changes, children are auto-flagged as *Suspect* until reviewed.
* **Approval Workflow** – move items from *Draft* → *Approved* with one click, and clear suspect flags when validations pass.
* **Private Workspaces** – every logged-in user sees only their documents; guests explore sandbox demos without changing prod data.
* **Health Snapshot Panel** – at a glance, see counts of Draft, Approved, Suspect, and Unlinked specs for any document.
* **Version History & Diff** – step back through edits or compare two versions to spot wording changes (plug in Git or your DB of choice).
* **Export & API Hooks** – shoot requirements to JSON, CSV, or downstream validation pipelines with a simple REST call.

Behind the scenes, everything is pure Python with Reflex—swap the SQLite stub for Postgres, add SSO, or stream diff events to Jira, and you’ve got a production-ready requirements cockpit in minutes.
