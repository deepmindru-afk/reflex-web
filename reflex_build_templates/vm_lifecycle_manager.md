# VM Lifecycle Manager

Ops teams shouldn’t SSH into every host just to reboot or snapshot a VM.
This lightweight dashboard exposes power controls, tagging, and audit trails in one dark-mode screen so platform engineers can keep fleets healthy—zero command-line gymnastics required.

### What you can build

* **Unified VM Catalog** – browse every instance—status, IP, provider, and custom tags—in one sortable table.
* **One-Click Power Controls** – Start, Stop, Reboot, or Pause a VM with confirmation dialogs and live status updates.
* **Snapshot Vault** – create, list, restore, or delete snapshots; visualize age and disk size at a glance.
* **Bulk Tag & Filter** – select multiple VMs to add or clear tags, then filter the list by tag, status, or provider.
* **Action Audit Log** – see who changed what and when with a searchable, tamper-proof timeline.
* **Role-Based Access** – grant Ops full control while Viewers get read-only insight—no accidental shutdowns.
* **Provider-Agnostic Adapter Layer** – swap the mock hypervisor stubs for AWS EC2, VMware vSphere, Proxmox, or OpenStack without touching the UI.

Under the hood it’s all pure Python with Reflex—swap the fake job queue for real hypervisor SDK calls, point the audit service at your SIEM, and you’ve got a production-ready VM control plane in minutes.
