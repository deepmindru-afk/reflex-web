# ML-Service Admin Console

Every model experiment, metric, and promotion—on a single screen.
The console captures new runs, renders heat-maps or confusion matrices for instant insight, and lets teams push the top performer to **production** with one click.

### What you can build

* **Experiment Dashboard** – sortable table of runs with owner, tags, and every metric your team cares about.
* **Run Registration Form** – upload artifacts, hyper-parameters, and metrics straight into Postgres; auto-refreshes the dashboard.
* **Visual Diagnostics** – overlay attention maps on images or draw confusion matrices for classification tasks, all rendered client-side.
* **Best-Model Ribbon** – automatically highlights the run with the highest key metric (default *accuracy*).
* **One-Click Promotion** – “Promote to Prod” moves the chosen model to the **production** stage and archives the previous one.
* **Role-Based Access** – **Admins** can upload and promote; **Viewers** get read-only insight.

Under the hood it’s pure Python with Reflex—swap the mock endpoints for MLflow, WandB, or S3 storage, wire promotions to your CI/CD, and you have a production-ready MLOps control tower in minutes.
