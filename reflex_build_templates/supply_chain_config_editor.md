# Supply-Chain Config Editor

Modern fulfillment centers run on thousands of rule tweaks—from which chute an urgent order takes to how fast an AMR accelerates around corners.
Give ops staff a single UI to review, validate, and apply those tweaks safely, without ever opening a SQL prompt.

### What you can build

* **Fleet-Stats Cards** – live tiles that surface robot count, distance covered, and battery health at a glance.
* **Route-Rule Form** – point-and-click builder to add or tweak origin → destination lanes with priority and JSON constraints.
* **Pending-Changes Tray** – every edit queues in a sidebar showing a before ↔ after diff so ops can review in bulk.
* **Instant Commit & Rollback** – ship the whole change-set with one click—or revert any individual tweak from the audit log.
* **Audit Ledger** – searchable timeline of every action (who, what, when) with inline “Revert” buttons.
* **Robot Registry Table** – list each bot’s model, speed cap, and current route; inline editing validates safe ranges.
* **Guard-railed Inputs** – numeric and JSON fields auto-check for out-of-range or malformed values before save.
* **Pocket-Sized UI** – responsive layout that shrinks gracefully for phone scanners on the warehouse floor.


Swap the built-in fake data generator for your Postgres production tables, plug in your existing auth provider, and you’ve got a production-ready configuration cockpit—written entirely in Python with Reflex.
